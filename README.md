This script is just a timer that when counts down to 0 will serverhop to any other server, very useful for grinding games that dont let you get a reward twice in the same server. put in autoexecute for those games

Loadstring: 

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joshuatszpock/ServerhopTimer/refs/heads/main/source",true))()

loadstring may break the code since my script is kinda teribbly made
the source might be obfuscated bcz the code is trash but maybe not
